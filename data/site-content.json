My work spans distributed compute (Spark, ECS/Fargate), cloud data platforms (AWS, Snowflake), and agentic AI pipelines built with LangGraph, LangChain, Milvus/pgvector, RAGAS, and reranker-driven retrieval.",
        "I design and deploy multi-cloud ELT/ETL systems with event-driven ingestion, metadata-rich lakehouse layers, semantic indexing, and dbt-validated transformations. My retrieval work includes hybrid search (BM25 + dense embeddings), vector-store optimization, and latency-aware context selection for real-world RAG deployments.",
        "On the production side, I focus on containerized orchestration, Terraform-driven IaC, CI/CD automation, cost-efficient Snowflake optimization, and observability tooling (Langfuse, CloudWatch). My systems support high-throughput analytics, feature reuse, and reliable LLM inference at enterprise scale.",
